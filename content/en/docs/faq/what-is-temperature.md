Temperature is a parameter that controls randomness when picking words during text creation. Low values of temperature make the text more predictable and consistent, while high values let more freedom and creativity into the mix, but can also make things less consistent. Temperature can vary from 0 to 1.

* Temperature closer to 0: Responses are very predictable, always choosing the next most likely word. This is great for answers where facts and accuracy are really important.

* Temperature closer to 1: The model takes more chances, picking words that are less likely, which can lead to more creative but unpredictable answers.


### **Examples of Temperature**

* **Temperature = 0**: If you ask, “What are the benefits of exercising?”, with a temperature of 0, the model might say: “Exercising improves heart health and muscle strength, lowers the chance of chronic diseases, and helps manage weight.”

* **Temperature = 1**: With the same question on exercise and a temperature of 1, you might get: “Exercise is the alchemist turning sweat into a miracle cure, a ritual dancing in the flames of effort and reward.”
