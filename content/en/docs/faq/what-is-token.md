Tokens are pieces of words used for natural language processing.

For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words.

As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.

To learn more about how tokens work and estimate your usage you can visit OpenAI [Tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).
