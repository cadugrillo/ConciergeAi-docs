<!-- Chat Completions is where you interact via text, or image (when available) with the most advanced LLMs (Large Language Models) on the market.

The easiest way to start is by selecting a Thread (by clicking on it) and start typing your messages. If you don't have any Threads, create one by using the "add" button (1).

You can only type/send your message, upload an image (4) or dictate (5) when a Thread is selected.
